            "Chinese: 大家好，如果你最近在社交媒體上關注我或閱讀這個博客，你可能會注意到我有點痴迷於發布使用 gpt3 的免費腳本，gpt3 是一種機器學習人工智能語言模型，我認為現在事情已經到了這樣的地步，我真的有很多這樣的東西，我開始用它們讓人們瘋狂，但我真正喜歡把它們放在那裡的其中一件事就是看看如何人們已經採用了這些腳本和這些表格並對其進行了調整併將不同的用例應用於它們所以我認為我要做的不是僅僅把另一個放在一起我要做的是將一系列短視頻放在一起向您展示如何自己完成此操作，因為這確實不是一個困難的過程，除了提出要生成的不同腳本的想法之外，我真的不能相信所做的任何事情，因為您確實不需要任何編碼經驗將這些腳本放在一起，我只是想向您展示這是一個多麼簡單的過程，它會帶您完成創建此工作表的整個流程，這是我今天創建的一個新工作表，確實沒有花費任何時間，所以我只是向您展示這個腳本的作用 這個工作表的作用 然後我將製作一些後續視頻 然後帶您完成創建這個腳本的過程 但不僅是這個還可以創建任何 Google 腳本你想要利用 gpt3 或任何其他機器學習 API 你可以將它適應各種不同的用途所以讓我首先向你展示它的作用所以這是我創建的一個新腳本我已經稱為 gpt3 公式生成器，所以如果您是 Google 表格的用戶，您可能經常在單元格中使用公式，因此當您需要在一個單元格中得出一個從其他單元格的值派生的值時，您可以創建一個公式通常你所做的是以一個等號開始它表明這是一個公式，然後你輸入任何函數來得到你正在尋找的結果，所以你知道一個非常簡單的公式，例如，假設你只想加起來讓我們想像有兩個數字這張表讓我去這裡我將把四和五放在那兒的那些行然後讓我們想像我想要這兩個的總和這樣我們就可以在等於之前創建一個公式所以就是賣A9 A9\n",
